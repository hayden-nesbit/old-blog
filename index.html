      <h1>Week 1</h1>

      <div class="week">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>
            <p>Week one flew by--but was not without moments that felt painfully long (fumbling through Git, navigating the Command Line, etc.). I expected to struggle, and to feel a little overwhelmed, but wasn't sure <i>how</i> I would struggle. That's where I've been living: swimming in questions I didn't know I needed to ask!</p>
        <h3>2. What are you struggling with?</h3>
            <p>In some sense I feel like everything's a struggle (re: swimming in questions!). But specifically, I'm still tiptoeing my way around GitHub, poking around in the Command Line, and crossing my fingers that repo's magically appear!</p>
        <h3>3. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
            <p>With the Command Line feeling a little more like home each day, I'm excited to continue uncovering its power. Beyond the CL, I'm eager to jump into html--the little bit I've picked up thus far has me itching to dive in deeper! (Specifically, how to make this text not run the length of the page!) </p>
      
 

        <h2>"Aha" moments:</h2>
          <ul>
	          <li><i>"'cd' is just going in and out of directories!"</i></li>
	          <li><i>"'man' lets me see what any command does!"</i></li>
	          <li><i>"The Command Line controls everything!"</i></li>
          </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>1. What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?</h3>
            <p>Pseudo code is very helpful. Its use of fuller language reminds me of formulas in spreadsheets--where Iâ€™ve had most of my experience. The language itself seems very logical which is helpful for me. The high-level, descriptive nature of pseudo code is helpful for me as I come at programming as a beginner; having a tool like this to layout big-picture components with easy to understand comments will be a huge help!</p>
